We are going to do model testing on bibaries from the RERS 2016 or 2017 challenges. 
The first step is to download and install fMBT, so go to:

fMBT - https://01.org/fmbt

fMBT only runs under Linux, so you will need a virtual environment if you own a windows machine.

If you have an Ubuntu machine, you just need to run the following commands in order:
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:antti-kervinen/fmbt-devel; 
sudo apt-get update; 
sudo apt-get install fmbt*

Then, if not already done for the previous assignments, you need to download and unpack the RERS challenge programs:

RERS 2016 reachability problems - http://www.rers-challenge.org/2016/problems/Reachability/ReachabilityRERS2016.zip
RERS 2017 reachability training problems - http://rers-challenge.org/2017/problems/training/RERS17TrainingReachability.zip
